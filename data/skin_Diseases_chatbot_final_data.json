        "response":"Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition, which means the immune system gets activated mistakenly and starts attacking healthy cells, leading to inflammation and the rapid overproduction of skin cells. \n\nNormally, skin cells grow and shed over a month. However, in people with psoriasis, this process speeds up and happens in just a few days. The buildup of these cells leads to thick, scaly patches on the skin's surface, a characteristic symptom of psoriasis.\n\nWhile the exact cause is still unknown, a combination of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors appear to play a role. Triggers such as stress, skin injuries, certain medications, or infections can initiate or exacerbate the condition.

        "response":"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) has a generally good prognosis. It's a benign condition that doesn't pose major health risks. However, it can cause significant cosmetic concerns due to the appearance of the skin. \n\nWith appropriate treatment, which may include topical or oral medications, the skin's appearance can be significantly improved.

The condition is characterized by dark, scaly patches or plaques that appear to be networked or 'reticulated'. These typically occur on the chest, neck, and back.\n\nIn some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This involves removing a small sample of the affected skin to be examined under a microscope. In CRP, the biopsy would typically show papillomatosis (a benign, wart-like skin growth) and hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin).\n\nIt's also important to rule out other skin conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as acanthosis nigricans, tinea versicolor, and Darier's disease.

        "response":"Actinic keratoses are usually removed because they are unsightly or uncomfortable, or because of the risk that skin cancer may develop in them. The latter point is a matter of considerable debate, and the most robust studies (Cochrane review) did not find convincing evidence that AK treatment resulted in a prevention of invasive squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nTreatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells. Epidermis regenerates from surrounding or follicular keratinocytes that have escaped sun damage.\nSome AKs will resolve with the frequent and appropriate use of sunscreens.\n\nTender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation.\n\nPhysical treatments are used to destroy individual keratoses that are generally symptomatic or have a thick hard surface scale. The lesions may recur in time, in which case they may be retreated by the same or a different method.\n\nLiquid nitrogen spray is required to achieve adequate depth and duration of the freeze. This varies according to lesion location, width, and thickness. Healing varies from 5\u201310 days on the face, 3\u20134 weeks on the hands, and 6 weeks or longer on the legs. A light freeze for a superficial actinic keratosis usually leaves no mark, but longer freeze times result in hypopigmentation or scar.\n\nShave, curettage (scraping with a sharp instrument) and electrocautery (burning) may be necessary to remove a cutaneous horn or hypertrophic actinic keratosis. Healing of the wound takes several weeks or longer, depending on the body site. The specimen is sent for histological examination.\n\nExcision ensures the actinic keratosis has been completely removed, which should be confirmed by pathology. The surgical wound is sutured (stitched). The sutures are removed after a few days, the time depending on the size and location of the lesion. The procedure leaves a permanent scar.\n\nCreams are used to treat areas of sun damage and flat actinic keratoses, sometimes after physical treatments have been carried out. Field treatments are most effective on facial skin. Pretreatment with keratolytics (such as urea cream, salicylic acid ointment or topical retinoid), and thorough skin cleansing improves response rates. Results are variable and the course of treatment may need repeating from time to time. With the exception of diclofenac gel, field treatments all result in local inflammatory reactions such as redness, blistering and discomfort for a varying length of time.\n\n\u2022 Diclofenac is more often used as an anti-inflammatory drug. A special gel formulation (3%) in a base containing sodium hyaluronate) is applied twice daily for 3 months, it is fairly well tolerated in the treatment of actinic keratoses, but less effective than the other options listed here.\n\u2022 Piroxicam - similar to diclofenac.\n\u2022 5-Fluorouracil is a cytotoxic agent. The cream formulation is applied once or twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks. Its effect may be enhanced by calcipotriol ointment. 5-fluorouracil may be available as a combination product along with salicylic acid.\n\u2022 Skin peels using trichloroacetic acid or Jessner solution.\n\u2022 Imiquimod cream is an immune response modifier. It is applied 2 or 3 times weekly for 4 to 16 weeks.\n\u2022 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves applying a photosensitiser (a porphyrin chemical such as methyl aminolevulinic acid) to the affected area prior to exposing it to a source of visible light.\n\u2022 Tirbanibulin is a synthetic inhibitor of tubulin polymerisation and protein kinase signalling. This 5 day topical treatment received a product license in countries such as the USA, UK, and Germany in 2021.\n\u2022 Oral retinoids have been used in organ transplant recipients and are shown to reduce the risk of SCC development in those with numerous AKs."

Over time the dermatitis becomes chronic and the skin becomes less red but thickened (lichenified) and scaly. Cracking of the skin (fissures) can occur.\n\nAt or shortly after birth, atopic dermatitis may initially present as infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis involving the scalp, and the armpit and groin creases. The skin often feels dry and rough. With time the face, especially the cheeks, and flexures become involved. Young infants cannot scratch and will often rub affected areas, for example the back of the head, causing temporary hair loss. The backs of the hands can be affected due to sucking. The dermatitis is not necessarily confined to these sites and can be more extensive. The napkin area is typically spared due to the moisture retention of nappies, although irritant contact napkin dermatitis can still develop.\n\nAs children grow and develop, the distribution of the dermatitis changes. With crawling, the extensor aspects of the elbows and wrists, knees and ankles are affected. The distribution becomes flexural with walking, particularly involving the antecubital and popliteal fossae (elbow and knee creases). Dribble and food can cause dermatitis around the mouth and chin. Scratching and chronic rubbing can cause the skin to become lichenified (thickened and dry), and around the eyes can lead to eye damage. Pityriasis alba, pompholyx, discoid eczema, pityriasis amiantacea, lip licker\u2019s dermatitis, and atopic dirty neck are various manifestations of atopic dermatitis seen particularly in school-age children and adolescents. During the school years, atopic dermatitis often improves, although the barrier function of the skin is never completely normal [see Barrier function in atopic dermatitis].\n\nAdult atopic dermatitis can take a variety of forms. It may continue in the school-age flexural pattern or become diffuse. Madarosis, nodular prurigo, and lichenification may follow chronic rubbing. Discoid and papular patterns can develop. For some who had atopic dermatitis in childhood with subsequent complete resolution, it may recur on the hands due to occupational and domestic duties [see Atopic hand dermatitis]. Unusually, atopic dermatitis may develop for the first time in adulthood, as \u2018adult onset\u2019 atopic dermatitis. In women and some men, involvement of the nipples and areolae can be problematic [see Nipple eczema].\n\nKeratosis pilaris, white dermographism, hyperlinear palms, and Dennie-Morgan folds can be useful clues for atopy. A Dennie-Morgan fold is a fold of skin under the lower eyelids due to chronic eyelid dermatitis.\n\nFor more images: Atopic dermatitis images and Atopic flexural eczema images\n\nDermoscopy of dermatitis shows a patchy distribution of dotted vessels, focal white scales, and yellow serocrust.

Underestimation may also occur due to cultural factors and communication difficulties between patients, parents, and healthcare providers.\n\nPatients with skin of colour appear to be at particular risk of developing lichen simplex and nodular prurigo with scratching and rubbing.\n\nPostinflammatory hypo- and hyper-pigmentation occurs more commonly with skin of colour and can be more noticeable than in ethnic white skin, resulting in significant psychological distress."

The ulcer can be painful, particularly if irritated by movement or eating certain types of food such as citrus fruit.\n\nPeople may experience a single ulcer or multiple ulcers. Multiple ulcers tend to be widely distributed throughout a person's mouth.\n\nAphthous ulceration is classified into three types.\n\n\u2022 Recurrent minor aphthous ulcer (80%). This is less than 5 mm in diameter and heals within 1\u20132 weeks.\n\u2022 Major aphthous ulcer, which is large (often more than 10 mm) and takes weeks or months to heal and leaves a scar.\n\u2022 Herpetiform ulcers, which are multiple pinpoint ulcers that heal within a month. These are most commonly on the tongue."

It can occur in younger adults, but bullous pemphigoid in infants and children is rare.\n\n\u2022 Bullous pemphigoid occurs equally in males and females.\n\u2022 There is an association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) indicating a genetic predisposition to the disease.\n\u2022 It is more prevalent in older patients with neurological disease, particularly stroke, dementia and Parkinson disease.\n\u2022 The risk of developing bullous pemphigoid is greater in people with psoriasis, and it can be precipitated by treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy.\n\u2022 There may be an association with internal malignancy in some patients.\n\u2022 A drug, an injury, or skin infection can trigger the onset of disease.\n\u2022 Rarely, bullous pemphigoid can be associated with acquired haemophilia due to anti-factor VIII antibody formation.\n\nThe most common drugs associated with bullous pemphigoid are the PD1-inhibitor immunotherapies (such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab) used to treat metastatic melanoma and other cancers.\n\nPemphigoid occurs in 0.3% of cancer patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, and may develop after 12 months of therapy, or even after they are discontinued. Prodromal itch before blistering and mucosal blisters are common. Drug withdrawal is usually required.\n\nDipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (often called 'gliptins'), used to treat diabetes mellitus (such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin and especially, vildagliptin), have also been reported to induce bullous pemphigoid. The median time to onset of bullous pemphigoid is 11 months after initiation of therapy. Unusually, mucosal involvement occurs.\n\nOther cases of bullous pemphigoid have been associated with antibiotics, penicillamine, potassium iodide, frusemide, captopril, gold, penicillin, sulfasalazine, topical fluorouracil, and second-generation antipsychotics (eg, risperidone, olanzapine)."

    {
        "prompt":"What causes bullous pemphigoid?",
        "response":"Bullous pemphigoid is the result of an attack on the basement membrane of the epidermis by IgG +\/- IgE immunoglobulins (antibodies) and activated T lymphocytes (white blood cells). The target is the protein BP180 (also called Type XVII collagen), or less frequently BP230 (a plakin). These proteins are within the NC16A domain of collagen XVII. They are associated with the hemidesmosomes, structures that ensure the epidermal keratinocyte cells stick to the dermis to make a waterproof seal.\n\nThe binding of the autoantibodies to the proteins and release of cytokines from the T cells lead to complement activation, recruitment of neutrophils (acute inflammatory cells) and the release of proteolytic enzymes. These destroy the hemidesmosomes and cause the formation of subepidermal blisters.\n\nThe association of neurological diseases with bullous pemphigoid is thought to relate to the presence of collagen XVII in the central nervous system and skin hemidesmosomes.\n\nA rare variant of pemphigoid with IgG antibodies directed against a 200 kDa DEJ protein has been described \u2013 there is a strong association with psoriasis (laminin gamma 1)."

The melanocytes of blue naevi are located deeper in the skin within the dermis as compared to those of brown naevi, which are located in the more superficial epidermis.\n\nIt has been held that the deeper location of dermal melanocytes in blue naevi causes their colour to be perceived by the eye as bluish. This phenomenon has classically been extrapolated to be due to the Tyndall effect, which posits that shorter (blue) wavelengths of incident light are preferentially scattered by the deeper-located dermal melanocytes; this is in contrast to the more superficially located epidermal melanocytes which appear brown.\n\nA more recent study, however, has suggested that the perception of blue colour in blue naevi may be more aptly regarded as a relative decrease in scatter of higher wavelength red light rather than as an increase in scatter of lower wavelength blue light. Thus, these authors conclude that blue naevi are perceived as blue because they scatter less red light, leading to a shift in hue toward blue (\u201csubtractive colour mixing\u201d), rather than because they scatter more blue light."

Itching purpura can also affect trunk and upper limbs. Itching leads to scratching and lichenification.\n\nGougerot-Blum capillaritis is less common. The patches are thickened and itchy, rather like eczema, but pathology is of a lichenoid reaction.\n\nIn this condition there are dilated capillaries as well as brown patches and cayenne spots. Annular patches gradually spread outwards and form concentric rings.\n\nCapillaritis has been reported to be due to khaki clothing dye and to rubber. It only affects skin in contact with the responsible material.\n\nLichen aureus is a solitary brown-yellow patch that is very persistent. It often overlies a varicose vein.\n\nCapillaritis may develop on the ankles following prolonged or vigorous exercise (eg, after 18 holes of golf, tramping, or dancing), especially during warm weather. The spots fade to brown within a few days and eventually disappear. A burning sensation may occur as the new lesions appear. Exercise-induced capillaritis can occur on a single occasion or recur regularly after exercise."

        "prompt":"How does cryotherapy work?",
        "response":"Cryotherapy works by using a cryogen to cool the targeted lesion to sub-zero temperatures causing direct tissue necrosis. The thawing process induces osmolarity changes which also results in tissue damage.\n\nCryotherapy using liquid nitrogen involves the use of a cryospray, cryoprobe, or a cotton-tipped applicator. The dose, freeze-time, and delivery method depend on the location, depth, size, and tissue type of the lesion.\n\nLiquid nitrogen spray methods include:\n\n\u2022 Timed spot freeze technique\/direct spray technique (standard treatment)\n\u2022 Paintbrush method\n\u2022 Rotary or spiral spray.\n\nWith the timed spot freeze technique, the spray gun is positioned 1 to 1.5cm above the centre of the skin lesion and sprayed until an ice ball encompasses the lesion (and required margin). The ice field is then maintained for 5 to 30 seconds depending on the lesion and depth of freeze. The treatment is repeated in some cases once thawing has completed. This is known as a \u2018double freeze-thaw\u2019.\n\nCarbon dioxide cryotherapy involves making a cylinder of frozen carbon dioxide snow or a slush combined with acetone. It is applied directly to the skin lesion.\n\nDMEP comes in an aerosol can and is often available over-the-counter. It is used to treat warts using a foam applicator pushed onto the skin lesion for 10\u201340 seconds, depending on its size and site."

It has been estimated that at least 1 in every 10,000 patients treated with an anticonvulsant will develop drug hypersensitivity syndrome.\n\nThe risk of drug hypersensitivity syndrome in patients on allopurinol depends on the dose of allopurinol, associated kidney disease, and concomitant thiazide diuretics.\n\nIt has been rarely reported with many other medications. It can be very difficult to determine the exact cause of drug hypersensitivity syndrome if several medicines have been commenced in preceding weeks. In about 10% of cases, the causative drug is never identified.\n\nDrug hypersensitivity syndrome occurring within 2 weeks of starting the responsible drug is most likely with beta-lactam antibiotics or iodinated contrast media. onset is delayed more than 2 weeks with anticonvulsants and allopurinol."

A temporal association between medicine use and the start of the syndrome is the strongest evidence.\n\nThe European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs and Collection of Biological Samples (RegiSCAR) has produced diagnostic criteria to assist in the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity syndrome. RegiSCAR inclusion criteria for potential cases require at least 3 of the following:\n\n\u2022 Hospitalisation\n\u2022 Reaction suspected to be drug-related\n\u2022 Acute skin rash\n\u2022 Fever above 38C\n\u2022 Enlarged lymph nodes at two sites\n\u2022 Involvement of at least one internal organ\n\u2022 Blood count abnormalities such as low platelets, raised eosinophils, or abnormal lymphocyte count.\n\nAttempts to confirm which drug has caused drug hypersensitivity syndrome may include patch tests. Patch testing has been reported to be most successful for anticonvulsant drugs, with 50% positive reactions. It is not useful for allopurinol, with 0% positive reactions. Lymphocyte transformation testing is available in some centres, where specialist interpretation may reveal the causative drug in the majority of cases.\n\nAfter taking a careful history and performing skin and general examination, the following tests may be requested.\n\nSkin biopsy usually shows dense infiltration of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and eosinophils, extravasated erythrocytes, and oedema.\n\nBlood tests may include:\n\n\u2022 Blood count and coagulation studies\n\u2022 Biochemical tests: at least liver function, renal function, muscle enzymes\n\u2022 Viral serology: hepatitis B, C, EBV, CMV, HHV-6\n\u2022 Endocrine function: thyroid, glucose levels\n\u2022 Genetic susceptibility tests.\n\nUrinalysis is undertaken to assess renal damage.\n\nCardiac and pulmonary evaluation may include electrocardiograph (ECG), echocardiogram, and chest X-ray.

A study has demonstrated decreased skin barrier function when frequent bath oils are used in infants less that 12 months of age.\n\nHumectant agents are hydrophilic (\u2018water-loving\u2019), therefore attract and retain water in the stratum corneum, similar to the natural hydrating factors found in corneocytes. They include:\n\n\u2022 Glycerine\n\u2022 Urea\n\u2022 Alpha hydroxy acids (eg, lactic acid or glycolic acid)\n\u2022 Salicylic acid.\n\nUrea and other acidic preparations often sting if applied to scratched or fissured skin.

If the infection involves the deep part of the follicle, it results in a painful boil. Recommended treatment includes careful hygiene, antiseptic cleanser or cream, antibiotic ointment, or oral antibiotics.\n\nSpa pool folliculitis is due to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which thrives in warm water. Gram-negative folliculitis is a pustular facial eruption also due to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other similar organisms. When it appears, it usually follows tetracycline treatment of acne but is quite rare.\n\nThe most common yeast to cause a folliculitis is Pityrosporum ovale, also known as Malassezia. Malassezia folliculitis (pityrosporum folliculitis) is an itchy acne-like condition usually affecting the upper trunk of a young adult. Treatment includes avoiding moisturisers, stopping any antibiotics and using topical antifungal or oral antifungal medication for several weeks.\n\nCandida albicans can also provoke a folliculitis in skin folds (intertrigo) or the beard area. It is treated with appropriate topical or oral antifungal agents.\n\nRingworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) usually results in scaling and hair loss, but sometimes results in folliculitis. In New Zealand, cat ringworm (Microsporum canis) is the commonest organism causing scalp fungal infection. Other fungi such as Trichophyton tonsurans are increasingly reported. Treatment is with an oral antifungal agent for several months.\n\nFolliculitis may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. This tends to be tender and resolves without treatment in around ten days. Severe recurrent attacks may be treated with aciclovir and other antiviral agents.\n\nHerpes zoster (the cause of shingles) may present as folliculitis with painful pustules and crusted spots within a dermatome (an area of skin supplied by a single nerve). It is treated with high-dose aciclovir.\n\nMolluscum contagiosum, common in young children, can present with follicular umbilicated papules, usually clustered in and around a body fold. Molluscum may provoke dermatitis.\n\nFolliculitis on the face or scalp of older or immunosuppressed adults may be due to colonisation by hair follicle mites (demodex). This is known as demodicosis.\n\nThe human infestation, scabies, often provokes folliculitis, as well as non-follicular papules, vesicles and pustules."

Keep it locked up so other people cannot mistakenly use it to treat a rash.\n\nPretreatment with cryotherapy or keratolytics, such as urea cream or glycolic acid lotion, is useful to minimise scaling and permit optimum absorption of the active ingredient, 5-FU.\n\nFluorouracil cream is applied once or twice a day after washing with plain water. A tiny amount of the cream should be gently rubbed into all of the treatment areas with a fingertip. It is important to apply it to all the skin and not just visible lesions. Afterwards, rinse the finger thoroughly with water (or use a glove or cotton bud to apply the cream). Treatment for actinic keratoses is continued for 2 to 4 weeks. Longer may be necessary for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in situ.\n\nThe manufacturer's guidelines indicate that the maximum area to be treated at one time is 500 cm2.\n\nSometimes fluorouracil cream is prescribed in combination with another topical agent.\n\n\u2022 The combination of 5% fluorouracil cream with tretinoin cream works best if the tretinoin has been used for at least two weeks prior to starting fluorouracil. Tretinoin cream enhances the effect of fluorouracil by peeling off the top layer of skin. It reduces the time required for the course of fluorouracil treatment. Tretinoin cream can be continued afterwards long term to reduce the signs of skin ageing and prevent deterioration, using very careful sun protection.\n\u2022 Combining low-potency 0.5% fluorouracil cream with 10% salicylic acid> (Actikerall\u2122) has also been shown to be effective for actinic keratoses on the face and hands and forearms over a 12-week course. It is especially useful for hyperkeratotic (horny) lesions.\n\u2022 5% fluorouracil cream with 0.005% calcipotriol ointment has been reported to improve efficacy and reduce the number of days required for treatment of actinic keratoses compared to 5% fluorouracil cream alone.\n\nFluorouracil wraps, also known as chemowraps, are an in-office occlusive treatment for extensive field treatment for actinic keratoses and intraepidermal carcinomas. They are most often used to treat severely sun damaged lower legs. After cleansing the area to be treated, a thick coat of fluorouracil cream is applied to scaly lesions and surrounding skin, often circumferentially around the limb. About 10 to 20 g of 5-FU is used for each limb. Paraffin gauze is applied over the fluorouracil cream to areas of movement (eg ankle) as protection. The limb is then carefully bandaged using loose layers of zinc oxide (to improve healing and reduce pain), cotton conforming bandage and crepe or self-adherent roll for compression.\n\nThe chemowrap is left in place for 7 days, then removed. The treated skin is washed and gently scrubbed to remove loose skin and scabs. Fluorouracil treatment is repeated once weekly for 4 to 12 weeks. If treated areas become eroded, treatment is stopped and petroleum jelly is applied to the affected area. It can be recommenced if necessary."

After five to ten days of treatment, the sun-damaged parts of treated skin become red, scaly and tender. As treatment is continued, sores and crusts may appear. These raw areas result from the destruction of defective skin cells. They are a necessary part of treatment and are expected to heal, once the treatment is stopped.\n\nTreated areas can be covered with a light dressing or left open. An occlusive dressing will increase penetration of 5-FU and enhance the effect and adverse reactions. Make-up can be worn if the reaction is mild, but should be avoided in the case of erosions and ulceration.\n\nArrange for your dermatologist, family doctor, or skin cancer nurse to review you during treatment to check on progress and to determine how long to continue using fluorouracil cream.

Keep it off the lips, unless specifically instructed to use it on this site. Use it with care in skin folds (such as those around the nose and lips), since it may irritate more severely in these areas.\n\nDue to interaction with sunlight, it is best to use fluorouracil cream during the winter months. Treated skin should normally be very carefully protected from the sun; stay indoors during the middle part of the day. If the treated area is inadvertently exposed to the sun, the reaction to fluorouracil is more vigorous than normal.\n\nThere have been several reports of detrimental effects on pets following accidental ingestion of fluorouracil.

After healing, the treated areas are often redder than normal and may feel more sensitive; this redness and sensitivity will gradually fade over a few weeks. Occasionally it persists for several months.\n\nPersistent or recurrent actinic keratoses can be treated with a further course of fluorouracil cream, imiquimod cream or by cryotherapy. However, it is important to ask your dermatologist if this is appropriate because skin cancers can look very similar and may need surgery or other procedures."

For more information, see histology stains and laboratory tests for fungal infection.\n\nFungal cultures can identify the causative organism and is the standard diagnostic test, however, results can take weeks and a large specimen collection may be required. This technique requires the nail to be cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol and soapy water prior to specimen collection.\n\nSamples should be taken prior to starting any treatment.\n\nPCR testing quickly identifies the offending organism and is highly sensitive and specific.

    {
        "prompt":"What causes fixed drug eruption?",
        "response":"Fixed drug eruption is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction. In the initial phase memory CD8+ T-cells at the dermo-epidermal junction release interferon-gamma when activated by the medication antigen causing epidermal basal layer damage. Recruited T-cells and neutrophils damage melanocytes and keratinocytes. During the resolution phase, dermal macrophages collect the melanin resulting in the typical post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Regenerating basal keratinocytes release interleukin-15 leading to the formation of resident memory CD8+ T-cells which remain quiescent but in a primed state ready to respond to the chemical antigen again.\n\nFixed drug eruption is usually due to oral medications, with antimicrobials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) being the most common culprits. Less common drug exposures may be topical or intravaginal. Fixed food eruptions may be due to antibiotics, flavouring or colouring agents, or preservatives in the food. Herbal supplements and caffeine have also been implicated. For a more detailed list, see the Appendix at the end."

        "response":"Fixed drug eruption can be categorised by clinical morphology. The most common form is the localised pigmenting type; other presentations include bullous (localised or generalised), mucosal, non-pigmenting, or generalised.\n\nFixed drug eruption typically presents as a single (or small number of) well-defined, round or oval red or violaceous patch or plaque which may blister or ulcerate. It is usually asymptomatic but can be itchy or painful. Over the next few days and weeks, the surface may become scaly or crusted before peeling, and the colour fades to leave brown post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation tends to be more prominent in skin of colour.\n\nIn contrast to many other drug eruptions, the patient remains systemically well.\n\nThe hands and feet, eyelids, and anogenital areas are common sites. Lesions in the oral mucosa are usually found on the lips, tongue and hard palate. A fixed drug eruption may occur at the same location as previous skin trauma such as a burn, insect bite, or venepuncture.\n\nOn the first occasion, the eruption may develop after weeks to years of regular ingestion of the drug, but subsequent episodes develop within minutes to hours of recommencing the implicated drug. A patch of fixed drug eruption shows a refractory period during which it will not flare even with re-exposure. With subsequent episodes, the original patch may enlarge and more patches may appear. The post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation darkens with each recurrence."

Around 40% of women by age 50 show signs of hair loss and less than 45% of women reach the age of 80 with a full head of hair.\n\nIn FPHL, there is diffuse thinning of hair on the scalp due to increased hair shedding or a reduction in hair volume, or both. It is normal to lose up to 50-100 hairs a day. Another condition called chronic telogen effluvium also presents with increased hair shedding and is often confused with FPHL. It is important to differentiate between these conditions as management for both conditions differ.\n\nFPHL presents quite differently from the more easily recognisable male pattern baldness, which usually begins with a receding frontal hairline that progresses to a bald patch on top of the head. It is very uncommon for women to bald following the male pattern unless there is excessive production of androgens in the body."

The mode of inheritance is polygenic, indicating that there are many genes that contribute to FPHL, and these genes could be inherited from either parent or both. Genetic testing to assess the risk of balding is currently not recommended, as it is unreliable.\n\nCurrently, it is not clear if androgens (male sex hormones) play a role in FPHL, although androgens have a clear role in male pattern baldness. The majority of women with FPHL have normal levels of androgens in their bloodstream. Due to this uncertain relationship, the term FPHL is preferred to \u2018female androgenetic alopecia\u2019.\n\nThe role of oestrogen is uncertain.

After anagen, the hair dies (catagen hair) and no longer grows. It sits dormant in the follicle for a three-month phase called telogen. After telogen, the hair follicle undergoes another anagen phase to produce new hair that grows out of the same follicle. As it grows, the old telogen hair is dislodged or pushed out.

However, some women do experience hair regrowth with treatment. Results are variable, and it is not possible to predict who may or may not benefit from treatment.\n\nA Cochrane systematic review published in 2012 concluded that minoxidil solution was effective for FPHL. Minoxidil is available as 2% and 5% solutions; the stronger preparation is more likely to irritate and may cause undesirable hair growth unintentionally on areas other than the scalp.\n\nHormonal treatment, i.e. oral medications that block the effects of androgens (e.g. spironolactone, cyproterone, finasteride and flutamide) is also often tried.\n\nA combination of low dose oral minoxidil (eg, 2.5 mg daily) and spironolactone (25 mg daily) has been shown to significantly improve hair growth, reduce shedding and improve hair density.\n\nOnce started, treatment needs to continue for at least six months before the benefits can be assessed, and it is important not to stop treatment without discussing it with your doctor first. Long term treatment is usually necessary to sustain the benefits.\n\nCosmetic camouflages include coloured hair sprays to cover thinning areas on the scalp, hair bulking fibre powder, and hair wigs. Hair transplantation for FPHL is becoming more popular although not everyone is suitable for this procedure.\n\nLow-level laser therapy is of unproven benefit in pattern balding, but one device has been approved by the FDA for marketing. Platelet-rich plasma injections are also under investigation. Further studies are required to determine the magnitude of the benefit if any."

        "response":"Granuloma annulare can occur on any site of the body and is occasionally widespread. It only affects the skin. Granuloma annulare may cause no symptoms, but affected areas are often tender when knocked. The plaques tend to slowly change shape, size, and position.\n\nThe localised form is the most common type of granuloma annulare in general, and specifically in children. One or more skin coloured or red bumps form rings in the skin over joints, particularly the knuckles. The surface is smooth and the centre of each ring is often a little depressed. Localised granuloma annulare usually affects the fingers or the backs of both hands, but is also common on top of the foot or ankle, and over one or both elbows. Annular rings may be solitary or multiple, and grow outwards maintaining the ring shape before eventually clearing.\n\nSee more images of granuloma annulare ...\n\nGeneralised granuloma annulare usually presents in adults, as widespread skin-coloured, pinkish or slightly mauve-coloured patches. The disseminated type is composed of small papules, usually arranged symmetrically in poorly-defined rings 10 cm or more in diameter. They are often found around the skin folds of the trunk (armpits, groin). Itch is common. This is the commonest form associated with HIV.\n\nSubcutaneous granuloma annulare is an uncommon form seen mainly in children. It presents as rubbery lumps (nodules) on scalp margins, fingertips, and shins. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is also called pseudo-rheumatoid nodules because the subcutaneous lesions look rather like rheumatoid nodules; however, they do not arise in association with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPerforating granuloma annulare presents as yellowish plaques or papules on which a crust forms due to the elimination of damaged collagen through the epidermis. Perforating granuloma annulare is usually localised to the hands, but plaques may occasionally arise on any body site, especially within scars. Dermoscopy helps to confirm the presence of perforations in small papules within otherwise typical plaques of granuloma annulare. Perforating lesions are frequently itchy or tender. Perforating granuloma annulare is uncommon except in ethnic Hawaiians and in association with HIV. All age groups can be affected.\n\nAtypical granuloma annulare describes:\n\n\u2022 Granuloma annulare in unusual sites, such as the face, palms, and ears\n\u2022 Granuloma annulare with photosensitive distribution\n\u2022 Unusually severe or symptomatic granuloma annulare\n\nInterstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a finding noted on histology in some patients with extensive granuloma annulare or other disorders with similar clinical presentation."

        "prompt":"How is granuloma annulare diagnosed?",
        "response":"Granuloma annulare is usually diagnosed clinically because of its characteristic appearance. But sometimes the diagnosis is not obvious, and other conditions may be considered. Skin biopsy usually shows necrobiotic degeneration of dermal collagen surrounded by an inflammatory reaction. See granuloma annulare pathology.\n\nGranuloma annulare is often initially misdiagnosed as tinea because of the annular appearance; the lack of surface scale should lead away from this and other scaly rashes such as discoid eczema or psoriasis. Actinic granuloma is considered by some to be a photo-aggravated variant of granuloma annulare, and by others to be a distinct entity."

With each episode of herpes simplex, the virus grows down the nerves and out into the skin or mucous membranes where it multiplies, causing the clinical lesion. After each episode, it \"dies back\" up the nerve fibre and enters the resting state again.\n\nHSV causes lifelong infection with the potential for reactivation or recurrence.

The amount shed during active lesions is 100 to 1000 times greater. Minor injury helps spread the virus, especially into the skin.

In other cases of granulomatous cheilitis, granulomatous disease is more widespread.\n\nThe first symptom of granulomatous cheilitis is a sudden swelling of the upper lip. In most cases, this first episode goes away within hours or days. Swelling of the lower lip and one or both cheeks may follow in orofacial granulomatosis. Less commonly, the forehead, eyelids, or one side of the scalp may be involved. The swelling may feel soft, firm or nodular when touched.\n\nRecurrent attacks of granulomatous cheilitis may occur within days or even years after the first episode. At each episode, the swelling may become larger, more persistent and eventually become permanent. At this time the lips may crack, bleed and heal leaving a reddish-brown colour with scaling. This can be painful. Eventually, the lip takes on the consistency of hard rubber.\n\nSee more images of granulomatous cheilitis\n\nOther symptoms that may accompany granulomatous cheilitis include:\n\n\u2022 Fever, headache and visual disturbances\n\u2022 Mild enlargement of regional lymph nodes in 50% of cases\n\u2022 Fissured or plicated (pleat-like effect) tongue in 20\u201340% of cases\n\u2022 Facial palsy; this can be intermittent, then possibly permanent and can be unilateral or bilateral, and partial or complete.

It is particularly prevalent in people with a history of atopic dermatitis. [see also Atopic hand dermatitis]\n\nChronic hand dermatitis is estimated to affect 10\u201315% of the population and is a common cause of time lost from work.\n\nHand dermatitis is particularly common in industries involving wet work or exposure to chemicals such as cleaning, catering, metalwork, hairdressing, healthcare, housework, construction, painting and mechanical work. This is mainly due to contact with irritants, but specific contact allergies can contribute [2]."

These can damage the outer stratum corneum, removing lipids and disturbing the skin\u2019s barrier function. Water loss and inflammation lead to further impairment of barrier function.\n\nIn atopic dermatitis, a deficiency in or defective function of the filaggrin protein in the stratum corneum leads to barrier dysfunction resulting in water loss and easy penetration by irritants and allergens [3].\n\nContact allergy is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction with elicitation and memory phases involving T lymphocytes and release of cytokines [2]."

        "response":"Hand dermatitis may affect the backs of the hands, the palms, or both. It can be very itchy, often with a burning sensation, and is sometimes painful. It has acute, relapsing, and chronic phases.\n\nAcute hand dermatitis presents with:\n\n\u2022 Red macules, papules, and plaques\n\u2022 Swelling\n\u2022 Blistering, weeping, crusting\n\u2022 Fissuring.\n\nFeatures of chronic hand dermatitis include:\n\n\u2022 Dryness and scale\n\u2022 Lichenification.\n\nThere are various causes and clinical presentations of hand dermatitis.\n\nAtopic hand dermatitis is due to impaired skin barrier function and is triggered by contact with irritants. It usually involves the backs of the hands and around the wrists. It may manifest as a discoid or vesicular pattern of eczema. Patients will typically have signs of atopic dermatitis elsewhere such as in the flexures.\n\nDiscoid eczema (nummular dermatitis) tends to affect the dorsal surfaces of the hands and fingers as circumscribed plaques. Other sites of the body may or may not be affected.\n\nVesicular hand dermatitis is also known as pompholyx. Intensely itchy crops of skin-coloured blisters arise on the palms and the sides of the hands and fingers. Similar symptoms often affect the feet. It is likely this form of dermatitis is exacerbated by excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) such as in hot and\/or humid weather and with emotional stress.\n\nChronic relapsing vesiculosquamous dermatitis is a common pattern of palmar and finger dermatitis, in which episodes of acute vesicular dermatitis are followed by chronic scaling and fissuring.\n\nHyperkeratotic hand dermatitis is a chronic, dry, non-inflammatory palmar dermatitis. It can appear similar to palmar psoriasis but is less red and less well circumscribed.\n\nFingertip dermatitis can be isolated to one or several fingers.\n\nThe hands are the most common site for irritant contact dermatitis and are often due to wet work and repeated exposure to low-grade irritants. The finger-webs are the first place to be affected, but inflammation can extend to fingers, the backs of the hands and the wrists. Irritant contact dermatitis often spares the palms.\n\n\u2022 Acute irritant contact dermatitis is due to injury by potent irritants such as acids and alkalis, often in an occupational setting.\n\u2022 Repeated exposure to low-grade irritants such as water, soaps, and detergents leads to chronic cumulative irritant dermatitis.\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis may be difficult to distinguish from constitutional forms of hand dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis. There are about 30 common allergens and innumerable uncommon or rare ones that may affect the hands. Common allergens include nickel, fragrances, rubber accelerators and chromate (in gloves), and p-phenylenediamine (permanent hair-dye). Clues to contact allergy depend on the allergen, but may include:\n\n\u2022 Periodic flare-ups associated with certain tasks or places hours to days earlier\n\u2022 Irregular, asymmetrical distribution of the rash\n\u2022 Sharp border to the rash (eg, at the wrist, corresponding with the cuff of rubber glove)."

During a recurrence, the virus follows the nerves onto the skin or mucous membranes, where it multiplies, causing the clinical lesion. After each attack and lifelong, it enters the resting state.\n\nDuring an attack, the virus can be inoculated into new sites of skin, which can then develop blisters as well as the original site of infection."
    },
    {
        "prompt":"Who gets herpes simplex?",
        "response":"Primary attacks of Type 1 HSV infections occur mainly in infants and young children. In crowded, underdeveloped areas of the world, nearly all children have been infected by the age of 5. In less crowded places, the incidence is lower; for example, less than half of university entrants in Britain have been infected. Type 2 HSV infections occur mainly after puberty and are often transmitted sexually.\n\nHSV is transmitted by direct or indirect contact with someone with active herpes simplex, which is infectious for 7\u201312 days. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus in saliva or genital secretions can also lead to transmission of HSV, but this is infrequent, as the amount shed from inactive lesions is 100 to 1000 times less than when it is active. The incubation period is 2\u201312 days.\n\nMinor injury helps inoculate HSV into the skin. For example:\n\n\u2022 A thumb sucker may transmit the virus from their mouth to their thumb.\n\u2022 A health-care worker may develop herpetic whitlow\n\u2022 A rugby player may get a cluster of blisters on one cheek (\u2018scrumpox\u2019)."

        "prompt":"What are the clinical features of herpes simplex?",
        "response":"Primary infection with HSV can be mild or subclinical, but symptomatic infection tends to be more severe than recurrences. Type 2 HSV is more often symptomatic than Type 1 HSV.\n\nPrimary Type 1 HSV most often presents as gingivostomatitis, in children between 1 and 5 years of age. Symptoms include fever, which may be high, restlessness and excessive dribbling. Drinking and eating are painful, and the breath is foul. The gums are swollen and red and bleed easily. Whitish vesicles evolve to yellowish ulcers on the tongue, throat, palate and inside the cheeks. Local lymph glands are enlarged and tender.\n\nThe fever subsides after 3\u20135 days and recovery is usually complete within 2 weeks.\n\nPrimary Type 2 HSV usually presents as genital herpes after the onset of sexual activity. Painful vesicles, ulcers, redness and swelling last for 2 to 3 weeks, if untreated, and are often accompanied by fever and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nIn males, herpes most often affects the glans, foreskin and shaft of the penis. Anal herpes is more common in males who have sex with men than with heterosexual partners.\n\nIn females, herpes most often arises on the vulva and in the vagina. It is often painful or difficult to pass urine. Infection of the cervix may progress to severe ulceration.\n\nAfter the initial infection, whether symptomatic or not, there may be no further clinical manifestations throughout life. Where viral immunity is insufficient, recurrent infections are common, particularly with Type 2 genital herpes.\n\nRecurrences can be triggered by:\n\n\u2022 Minor trauma, surgery or procedures to the affected area\n\u2022 Upper respiratory tract infections\n\u2022 Sun exposure\n\u2022 Hormonal factors (in women, flares are not uncommon prior to menstruation)\n\u2022 Emotional stress\n\nIn many cases, no reason for the eruption is evident.\n\nThe vesicles tend to be smaller and more closely grouped in recurrent herpes, compared to primary herpes. They usually return to roughly the same site as the primary infection.\n\n\u2022 Recurrent Type 1 HSV can occur on any site, most frequently the face, particularly the lips (herpes simplex labialis).\n\u2022 Recurrent Type 2 HSV may also occur on any site, but most often affects the genitals or buttocks.\n\nItching or burning is followed an hour or two later by an irregular cluster of small, closely grouped, often umbilicated vesicles on a red base. They normally heal in 7\u201310 days without scarring. The affected person may feel well or suffer from fever, pain and have enlarged local lymph nodes.\n\nHerpetic vesicles are sometimes arranged in a line rather like shingles and are said to have a zosteriform distribution, particularly when affecting the lower chest or lumbar region.\n\nWhite patches or scars may occur at the site of recurrent HSV attacks and are more evident in those with the skin of colour.\n\nSee more images of herpes simplex."

The cells produce the three layers of the hair shaft (medulla, cortex, cuticle), which are mainly made of the protein keratin (which is also the main structure of skin and nails).\n\nHair growth follows a cycle. However, these phases are not synchronised, and any hair may be at a particular phase at random.\n\nThe three main phases of the hair cycle are:\n\nHair length depends on the duration of anagen. Short hairs (eyelashes, eyebrows, hair on arms and legs) have a short anagen phase of around one month. Anagen lasts up to 6 years or longer in scalp hair.\n\nImage \u00a9 1998 Merck Sharpe and Dohme (with permission)"

        "response":"The features of hair loss depend on the cause. Actual symptoms such as itch and soreness are generally absent unless caused by accompanying inflammatory skin disease. However, a burning, prickly discomfort known as trichodynia may accompany hair shedding.\n\nAnagen hair is tapered or broken-off. Anagen is variable in duration. Children with otherwise normal hair but that cannot grow their hair long may have short anagen syndrome.\n\nAnagen shedding is known as anagen effluvium and has a sudden onset.\n\nAnagen effluvium is caused by:\n\n\u2022 Autoimmune disease, including severe diffuse alopecia areata\n\u2022 Medications, especially cytotoxic\/chemotherapy drugs\n\u2022 An inherited or congenital condition, such as loose anagen syndrome\n\nShort broken hairs and empty follicles may be observed. If caused by a drug or toxin, hair growth can return to normal within 3\u20136 months of its withdrawal.\n\nTelogen hair has a bulb at the end (club hair). Excessive shedding is known as telogen effluvium. It occurs 2\u20136 months after an event that stops active hair growth.\n\nTelogen effluvium is caused by:\n\n\u2022 Child-bearing\n\u2022 Fever\n\u2022 Weight loss\n\u2022 Haemorrhage\n\u2022 A surgical operation, illness or psychological stress\n\u2022 Medications, including contraceptives, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants.\n\nSometimes there appears to be no recognisable cause for telogen effluvium, and shedding can continue for years (chronic telogen effluvium). Scalp hair continues to grow but has a shorter natural length than normal.\n\nPattern hair loss is due to genetic programming or hormonal influences. It is also called androgenetic alopecia because it is influenced by androgens.\n\nPattern alopecia is apparent in about 50% of individuals by the age of 50 years.\n\n\u2022 Male pattern alopecia affects vertex and temporal scalp.\n\u2022 Female pattern alopecia is less pronounced and affects the anterior scalp.\n\nHair shaft defects can be inherited and congenital, or acquired due to disease or injury (eg, excessive brushing, hair pulling [trichotillomania], hairdryer heat, relaxing chemicals, bleach). See African hair practices.\n\nHair shaft abnormalities are diagnosed by dermatoscopy or microscopic examination of the hair, and sometimes by scanning electron microscopy.

Recurrence rates are high, whatever method is used, particularly in immune suppressed patients.\n\nAs the risk of invasive SCC is low, it may not be necessary to remove all lesions, particularly in elderly patients. Keratolytic emollients containing urea or salicylic acid may be sufficient to improve symptoms.\n\nSolitary lesions can be cut out, and the defect repaired by stitching it up. Excision is often recommended if there is suspicion of invasive SCC.\n\nSuperficial skin surgery refers to shave, curettage and electrosurgery, and is an excellent choice for solitary or few hyperkeratotic lesions. The lesion is sliced off or scraped out; then the base is cauterised. Dressings are applied to the open wound to encourage moist wound healing over the next few weeks.\n\nCryotherapy means removing a lesion by freezing it, usually with liquid nitrogen. Moderately aggressive cryotherapy is suitable for multiple, small, flat patches of intraepidermal SCC. It leaves a permanent white mark at the site of treatment.\n\n5-fluorouracil cream contains a cytotoxic agent and can be applied to multiple lesions. The cream may be used for intraepidermal SCC for four weeks and repeated if necessary. It causes a vigorous skin reaction that may ulcerate.\n\nImiquimod cream is an immune response modifier used off-licence to treat intraepidermal SCC. It is applied 3\u20135 times weekly for 4\u201316 weeks and causes an inflammatory reaction.\n\nPhotodynamic therapy  (PDT) refers to treatment with a photosensitiser (a porphyrin chemical) that is applied to the affected area before exposing it to a strong source of visible light. The treated area develops an inflammatory reaction and then heals over a couple of weeks or so.

Regression and proliferation may be seen in same lesion.\n\u2022 Regression or involution phase (several years): The bright red colour changes to a dull grey surface associated with flattening, softening, and shrinking from the centre towards the periphery. While a grey stage is suggestive of involutional change, a white infantile haemangioma may be a sign of impending ulceration.

        "response":"Jewellery allergy is a common cause of contact allergic dermatitis. Most jewellery allergy is caused by the metals nickel (see nickel allergy) and cobalt (see cobalt allergy) which is used in the manufacture of precious metal alloys. In less expensive jewellery, nickel is often used in the base metal which is then plated with gold or silver. Many people who believe that they are allergic to gold or silver jewellery are allergic to nickel, which can occur as a trace element in gold or silver or has been used in the manufacture of gold jewellery to whiten and strengthen the piece.\n\nJewellery allergy presents as dermatitis in places where nickel-containing metal is touching the skin. The most common sites of jewellery allergy are the earlobes (from earrings), the fingers (from rings), and around the neck (from necklaces); the affected areas become intensely itchy and may become red and blistered (acute dermatitis) or dry, thickened and pigmented (chronic dermatitis). Sometimes dermatitis later affects areas that are not in contact with jewellery, particularly the hands. Pompholyx is a blistering type of hand dermatitis that is prevalent in people with a previous history of jewellery allergy and may be due to contact with other sources of nickel such as coins and keys."

Irritant reactions are more common in people that suffer from sensitive skin or atopic dermatitis\n\u2022 Psoriasis and vitiligo can koebnerise and arise at a site or injury; for example, they could arise at the site of a tight watch strap, necklace or bangle\n\u2022 A piercing site may be infected with Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in oozing and crusting (impetigo or wound infection).\n\nUnrelated rashes should also be considered if patch tests prove negative."
    },
    {
        "prompt":"How do I know if my jewellery contains nickel?",
        "response":"By looking at a piece of jewellery, it is very difficult to determine whether or not it contains nickel. One should assume that all metal jewellery has some amount of nickel in it unless it made of stainless (surgical) steel, is either 18- or 24-carat gold, is sterling silver, or pure platinum.\n\nGold for jewellery is typically measured in karats (also spelt carats).\n\n\u2022 24 karat (pure gold) contains 99.9% gold (plus 0.1% other metal).\n\u2022 18 karat is 75% gold.\n\u2022 12 karat is 50% gold.\n\u2022 Nine karat is 37.5% gold.\n\nTo make up the rest of the metal, gold is alloyed with other metals. For people with metal allergy, particularly nickel allergy, the question is which metals are your gold jewellery alloyed with? Gold can be alloyed with many different types of metals which alter its hardness, colour and other properties. For example, yellow gold may be alloyed with silver and copper, while white gold is usually alloyed with nickel. Rhodium, a silvery-white metal related to platinum, is often used to plate yellow gold to make it into white gold. And even white gold with nickel is often rhodium-plated to make it appear whiter and shinier. Although the initial plating will protect you against any nickel in the gold, it eventually wears off over months or years. This leaves the white gold (alloyed with nickel) in contact with your skin.\n\nThere are three grades of silver for jewellery \u2014 pure silver, sterling silver and silver-plated. Pure silver is 99.9% silver but can be too soft and malleable to handle when making into jewellery. Sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver alloyed with copper. In some cases of sterling silver, a small percentage of other metals may be in the mix so traces of nickel may be present. Silver-plated jewellery is a base metal (and may contain nickel) that has been plated with a fine layer of silver alloy."

Some people develop dermatitis (also called eczema) from even brief contact with nickel-containing items, while others after many years of wearing them without problems suddenly break out in a rash. This is usually confined to skin sites in contact with the metal but can spread more widely in severe cases.\n\nNickel allergy is more common in women, probably because they are more likely to wear jewellery than men, although this is changing. While nickel allergy is the most common jewellery allergy to occur, allergy to other metals used in jewellery is possible. However, it appears to be rare."

        "response":"If you have a jewellery allergy, a dermatologist can perform a skin patch test to determine if you have a metal allergy. Once your nickel or cobalt allergy is confirmed, it is essential to avoid contact with that metal. The following tips may help when purchasing jewellery.\n\n\u2022 Alternative white gold alloys are available based on palladium, silver and other white metals, but the palladium alloys are more expensive than those using nickel. High-karat white gold alloys are far more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver.\n\u2022 When having ears or other body parts pierced, have it done with a stainless steel needle and make sure your jewellery is made of stainless steel or either 18- or 24 karat gold.\n\u2022 Look for jewellery that is hypoallergenic, i.e. made of stainless steel, at least 18-karat gold, sterling silver, or polycarbonate plastic.\n\u2022 If you must wear earrings that contain nickel, add plastic covers made specifically for earring studs.\n\u2022 If your wedding ring or another item of jewellery that you wear daily causes a reaction, you can ask a jeweller about having it plated in a non-allergic metal, such as rhodium or platinum. However, the coating will eventually wear off and need re-plating.\n\nTest your metal items to see if they contain nickel or cobalt. Obtain a testing kit from your dermatologist, pharmacist, or online.\n\nYour dermatologist may have further specific advice, particularly if you are highly sensitive to nickel or other metals."

When activated, JAKs phosphorylate cell membrane cytokine receptors and intracytoplasmic STATs, thereby modulating gene transcription in the nucleus. The phosphate is provided by ATP, and each JAK and tyrosine kinase recognises a slightly different ATP-binding pocket. Overexpression of these pathways can result in the development of autoimmune disease and malignancies.\n\nJAK inhibitors (JAKi) can be classified as:\n\n\u2022 Pan-JAKi \u2014 delgocitinib, peficitinib\n\u2022 JAK1i \u2014 oclacitinib, upadacitinib, abrocitinib, itacitinib\n\u2022 JAK1\/2i \u2014 baricitinib, ruxolitinib\n\u2022 JAK1\/3i \u2014 tofacitinib\n\u2022 JAK3i \u2014 decernotinib, ritlecitinib\n\u2022 TYK2 inhibitors \u2014 deucravacitinib, brepocitinib.\n\nImage from: Singh R, Heron CE, Ghamrawi RI, Strowd LC, Feldman SR.

Tuberculosis screening should therefore be undertaken before starting treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Reactivation of herpes viruses appears to be common, therefore zoster vaccination prior to commencing treatment is recommended.\n\nCommon adverse side effects of JAK inhibitors include:\n\n\u2022 Nasopharyngitis\n\u2022 Infection of upper respiratory and urinary tracts\n\u2022 Headache\n\u2022 Nausea and diarrhoea\n\u2022 Acne - mild acne occurs in about 15% of those with eczema treated with JAKis - it is usually responsive to topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics or retinoids, and seldom requires drug withdrawal.\n\nSelective JAK inhibitors may show unique adverse effect profiles such as cytopenias linked to selective JAK2 inhibition.\n\nTofacitinib has been used long-term in patients with rheumatoid arthritis:\n\n\u2022 Increased lipids may be seen during the first 3 months of treatment, then stabilise\n\u2022 Malignancies are not increased except for non-melanoma skin cancers\n\u2022 The TGA in Australia warns high dose (10mg bd) should be used with caution in patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, serious infections, and herpes zoster infection.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA issued new updated black box warnings for baricitinib and upadacitinib in line with warnings already in place for tofacitinib. Tofacitinib has been reported to carry increased risks of serious heart-related events, blood clots, and death even at low dose. Although similar adverse events have not yet been reported with baricitinib and upadacitinib, the FDA found the risks have not been adequately evaluated and issued the warning due to the similar mechanisms of action.\n\nAn association between JAK inhibitors and malignancy (eg, T-cell lymphomas) is currently under investigation and is not fully understood. There have been rare cases of T-cell lymphomas reported in patients treated with JAK inhibitors, but the overall incidence appears to be low and causality has not been established.\n\nApproved datasheets are the official source of information for medicines, including approved uses, doses, and safety information.

        "prompt":"What causes juvenile idiopathic arthritis?",
        "response":"The exact cause of JIA is unclear, but a pronounced immune response in a perpetuating loop of both innate and adaptive immunity is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of JIA. Aberrant activation of the innate immune system lead to the dysregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 play a critical inciting role. The effects of these cytokines provide explanations for the various clinical features seen in systemic JIA. These effects include:\n\n\u2022 Bone marrow granulopoiesis (proliferation of granulocytes)\n\u2022 Increase in osteoclast activity (cells that absorb bone)\n\u2022 Hepatocyte stimulation\n\u2022 Activation of thermoregulatory functions (body temperature) [3,4].\n\nThe increased recruitment of inflammatory cells in the joint synovial membrane was demonstrated in several studies by a significant elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the synovial fluid of affected children. Proinflammatory cytokines in the synovium lead to increased production and accumulation of synovial fluid and thickening of the synovial lining. This chronic synovial inflammation is apparent and common to all JIA subtypes. In addition, RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 ligand) cytokine, which is associated with bone resorption (breakdown) and cartilage damage, was reported to be present in large amounts in the synovial membrane of children with JIA.\n\nSome studies have consistently supported associations between enthesitis-related JIA and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms; there appear to be increased associations, especially with early-onset disease. A monogenic form of systemic JIA with an underlying mutation in a regulatory protein involved in macrophage metabolism has been described [2,3].\n\nEnvironmental factors may contribute to the development of JIA. Some studies have suggested associations with exposure to antibiotics, a bacterial infection in immunosuppressed individuals, and maternal smoking during pregnancy [2,4]."

Persistent plaques, periorbital oedema, or erythema are less common but may be observed.\n\nAlthough rashes in JIA are seldom pruritic, they can be elicited by cutaneous injury or scratching (Koebner phenomenon), in which case the lesions exhibit a linear appearance.\n\nChildren with JIA often present with limping and stiffness, without any known injury or prior infections. Common non-cutaneous manifestations include:\n\n\u2022 Joint pain and swelling\n\u2022 High spiking daily fever (quotidian pattern)\n\u2022 Myalgia\n\u2022 Limited movement\n\u2022 Enthesitis\n\u2022 A sore throat\n\u2022 Lymphadenopathy\n\u2022 Hepatosplenomegaly [1\u20133]."

Further investigations including laboratory tests and imaging are helpful to confirm the diagnosis or to classify arthritis into a specific subtype. The test results can also be useful to guide treatment and to monitor the disease course.\n\nThe most relevant laboratory tests for JIA are:\n\n\u2022 A complete blood count \u2014 anaemia, thrombocytosis, and leucocytosis are often present in systemic JIA whereas they are not typically seen in oligoarticular JIA\n\u2022 Erythrocyte sediment rate (ESR) \u2014 this is significantly elevated in systemic JIA but may be normal or mild to moderately elevated in other subtypes\n\u2022 C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2014 this is elevated to varying degrees in the different subtypes of JIA\n\u2022 Antinuclear antibody (ANA) \u2014 this is often negative in systemic JIA but may be positive in oligoarticular and polyarticular forms of JIA\n\u2022 RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP); these are useful to identify RF-positive polyarthritis.\n\nPathology is not required for a definitive diagnosis of JIA, but the exanthem in systemic JIA characteristically exhibits a perivascular and interstitial neutrophil-dominant infiltrate; this can also be referred to as neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis, a common pattern in autoinflammatory processes [3].\n\nImaging can provide information about the involved joints if the clinical examination findings are equivocal.

Despite its name, it is no longer classified as a sarcoma (which is a malignant tumour of mesenchymal origin) as it is due to multicentric vascular hyperplasia.\n\nThere are four types of Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n\u2022 Classic type of Kaposi sarcoma \u2014 this affects older men of Mediterranean and Middle European descent and in men in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is associated with diabetes mellitus, but is not associated with HIV infection.\n\u2022 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi sarcoma \u2014 this mainly affects men who have sex with men (MSM). Kaposi sarcoma is one of the most common forms of cancer in Uganda and Zambia, especially in children.\n\u2022 Endemic or African Kaposi sarcoma \u2014 this arises in some parts of Africa in children and young adults.\n\u2022 Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma \u2014 as a result of drug treatment causing immune suppression.\n\nIn the United States, Kaposi sarcoma was particularly common in the 1980s. It remains prevalent amongst HIV-positive men who have had sex with men (MSM), in which it has a very aggressive course. It occurs less frequently in intravenous drug users and is rare in women, haemophiliacs, or their sexual partners. HIV\u2013associated Kaposi sarcoma is more common in women than in men in some parts of Africa. It has become less common in the US and Europe because of effective highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV.\n\nIatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma is a particular concern for organ transplant patients, especially in geographic areas associated with high levels of infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). Most have the virus before transplantation, but the drugs cause it to reactivate. Use of corticosteroids and biologics like rituximab, infliximab, and abatacept, prescribed for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, are also prone to develop Kaposi sarcoma."

Data is emerging that non-sexual modes of transmission can occur, possibly via saliva or arthropod bites.\n\u2022 It is also associated with the production of specific cytokines or cell signalling proteins, genetic factors, hormonal factors and immunodeficiency. Decreasing CD4 cell count has a strong association with AIDS-associated and classic Kaposi sarcoma.\n\nKSHV may lie dormant, or replicate and cause disease.

The patches evolve into plaques, nodules or scaly tumours.\n\nKaposi sarcoma in association with HIV infection may develop at any time during the illness. Generally, the greater the immunosuppression (eg, with CD4 cell counts less than 200\/mm3), the more extensive and aggressive the Kaposi sarcoma will be.\n\nKaposi sarcoma lesions can also occur internally; in the gut, lungs, genitals, lymphatic system and elsewhere. These internal lesions may cause symptoms such as:\n\n\u2022 Discomfort with swallowing\n\u2022 Bleeding\n\u2022 Haematemesis\n\u2022 Haematochezia\n\u2022 Melaena\n\u2022 Bowel obstruction\n\u2022 Shortness of breath\n\u2022 Swollen legs.\n\nSee more images of Kaposi sarcoma."

KSHV assays or antibody titres to KSHV are challenging to interpret. CD4 lymphocyte counts and plasma HIV load studies are performed in patients with HIV infection.\n\nThe appearance of Kaposi sarcoma lesions is often typical, but a skin biopsy of a lesion allows a definite diagnosis, as other conditions such as melanoma, fungal infections, and mycetoma mimic Kaposi sarcoma in appearance and location. The histopathology of Kaposi sarcoma shows red cells in slit-like spaces formed by atypical spindle cell proliferation of endothelial cells and associated with inflammatory cells.\n\nThere have been various attempts to classify Kaposi sarcoma, depending on whether it is localised or disseminated in the skin, and if there is a lymph node or internal organ involvement. The degree of immunosuppression present may also be used in staging systems.\n\nKaposi sarcoma has a variable course. Some patients develop only a few minor skin lesions while others have extensive external and internal disease. The latter lesions may result in fatal complications from bleeding, obstruction or perforation of an organ. Kaposi sarcoma is not curable, but it can be treated and its symptoms controlled."

Liposomal means that the drugs are coated in small fat bubbles, or liposomes, which allows better absorption, resulting in less cardiac toxicity and myelotoxicity. Paclitaxel is approved for use in Kaposi sarcoma in advanced stages or as a second-line option.\n\nImmunotherapy includes the use of interferon-alpha and imiquimod, sirolimus and thalidomide.\n\nKaposi sarcoma may arise in organ transplant patients. Switching from ciclosporin to sirolimus (rapamycin) has resulted in resolution of the sarcoma. This is primarily attributed to the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects of sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor).\n\nClinical trials into a wide range of other therapies are ongoing.\n\n\u2022 Photodynamic therapy is a combination of a photosensitiser and light energy.\n\u2022 Isotretinoin is a vitamin-A derivative usually used to treat acne.\n\u2022 Bexarotene is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\u2022 Cytokine inhibitors (biologics)\n\u2022 The pregnancy hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG); Kaposi sarcoma lesions disappear in some women when they become pregnant.\n\u2022 Ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet (antiviral medications) have been recently reported to result in lower rates of Kaposi sarcoma amongst those being treated for CMV retinitis (inflammation of the retina caused by cytomegalovirus) and are currently being studied.

IVIG is most effective when given between the 5th and 10th days of illness. Low dose oral aspirin is also usually commenced at this time.\n\nIVIG greatly reduces the risk of coronary artery disease and low dose aspirin reduces the risk of clotting within the coronary artery should coronary artery disease develop.

        "prompt":"How does a KTP laser work?",
        "response":"\u2022 The KTP laser works on the principle of selective photothermolysis.\n\u2022 The selected wavelength of laser light is absorbed to a high degree by the target structure (called a chromophore) and is absorbed less by surrounding tissue.\n\u2022 The skin chromophores targeted by the KTP laser are melanin, oxyhaemoglobin and red tattoo pigment.\n\u2022 The pulse duration of laser energy is shorter than the target structure\u2019s thermal relaxation time (the time taken for the target to cool by 50% of its peak temperature after irradiation).\n\u2022 This ensures that the impact of thermal energy is limited to the target structure and does not affect the surrounding tissue. Modern KTP lasers also have integrated cooling systems to help protect the epidermis, particularly when doing vascular work.\n\u2022 When KTP laser light hits the skin, it is reflected, transmitted, or absorbed.\n\u2022 Absorbed light energy is converted to thermal energy (heat) by the intended targets (chromophores), thereby killing the target cells.\n\u2022 Complications result when energy intended for the target chromophore is nonselectively diffused and absorbed by surrounding tissues and structures. Because melanin is targeted by this wavelength, the KTP laser is rarely used in darker skin types.\n\u2022 The effects of the KTP laser on the skin can be modified by altering the pulse width and degree of cooling. In the case of tattoo pigment, the pulse width is narrowed to nanoseconds (Q-switched KTP) and the clinical effect is photomechanical\/acoustic. Picosecond lasers may be more effective for pigment fragmentation but at very short pulse widths, the creation of a plasma veil is a limiting factor."

An ultrapotent topical steroid is often prescribed (eg, clobetasol propionate 0.05%).

However, the dermoscopic appearance of early lentigo maligna can be difficult to distinguish from other pigmented lesions, particularly on the face.\n\n\u2022 Melanocytic naevi (moles)\n\u2022 Solar lentigines\n\u2022 Pigmented  Actinic keratoses\n\u2022 Seborrhoeic keratoses\n\nFacial pigmented lesions are characterised dermoscopically by pseudonetwork \u2013 this is pigmentation arising around prominent facial hair follicles, and several types of skin lesion may appear rather similar to lentigo maligna. However, lentigo maligna shows greater variation in the thickness of the lines making up the network, often forming an atypical rhomboid pattern associated with greyish dots, the structure tends to be irregular, and there is variation in colour.\n\nIf a skin lesion is clinically suspicious of lentigo maligna, it is best cut out (excision biopsy) with a 2\u20133 mm margin. Partial biopsy is less accurate than complete excision biopsy, as a single small biopsy could miss a malignant focus. However sometimes the lesion is very large, and before performing significant surgery, a partial biopsy is arranged to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor should remove a long ellipse of skin, take biopsies from multiple sites or carefully shave a representative area for histology.\n\nThe pathological diagnosis of melanoma and its precursors can be very difficult. Some lesions clinically typical of lentigo maligna are reported to show junctional melanocytic proliferation alone (with or without atypia), others have the criteria to diagnose in situ melanoma, and a few show invasive cancer.\n\nThe histological features of lentigo maligna include a predominantly junctional confluent proliferation of melanocytes and extension along adnexal structures. Solar elastosis (degeneration of elastic tissue within dermis) is typically prominent. Immunostains eg SAC R21 may improve accuracy of diagnosis in borderline cases.\n\nThe pathologist's report should include a macroscopic description of the specimen and melanoma (the naked eye view), and a microscopic description. The following features should be reported if there is invasive melanoma.\n\n\u2022 Diagnosis of primary melanoma\n\u2022 Breslow thickness to the nearest 0.1 mm\n\u2022 Clark level of invasion\n\u2022 Margins of excision i.e. the normal tissue around the tumour\n\u2022 Mitotic rate \u2013 a measure of how fast the cells are proliferating\n\u2022 Whether or not there is ulceration\n\nThe report may also include comments about the cell type and its growth pattern, invasion of blood vessels or nerves, inflammatory response, regression and whether there is associated in-situ disease.\n\nThe Breslow thickness is reported for invasive melanomas. It is measured vertically in millimetres from the top of the granular layer (or base of superficial ulceration) to the deepest point of tumour involvement. It is a strong predictor of outcome; the thicker the melanoma, the more likely it is to metastasise (spread).\n\nThe Clark level indicates the anatomic plane of invasion.\n\nThe deeper the Clark level, the greater the risk of metastasis (secondary spread). It is useful in predicting outcome in thin tumours, and less useful for thicker ones in comparison to the value of the Breslow thickness."

        "response":"In most cases, lentigo maligna should undergo surgical excision. This means cutting it out and repairing the defect by simply closing the wound and stitching it up, creating a flap or by skin grafting.\n\nLentigo maligna has an unusually high risk of recurrence (up to 20%). For this reason, it is usually removed with a margin of healthy tissue, which can be difficult to achieve on facial skin. The ideal margin for all forms of melanoma in situ is 5-10mm, depending on how well defined are the edges of the lesion. Recommended margins for invasive melanoma are based on its thickness: it is 1 cm if less than 1 mm and 1-2 cm if the melanoma is over 1 mm in depth. If the margin and extent of the lentigo maligna is unclear, mapped serial excision may be recommended (margin-controlled, Mohs micrographic surgery or 'slow Mohs'), in an attempt to remove all the malignant cells and to spare healthy skin.\n\nOther treatments for lentigo maligna may be considered if it is difficult to remove the lesion surgically, or surgery will be very deforming, or there is a major contraindication to surgery:\n\n\u2022 Radiotherapy \u2014 superficial X-rays or electrons\n\u2022 Cryotherapy \u2014 undertaken by an expert\n\u2022 Imiquimod cream \u2014 not yet fully evaluated.\n\nHowever, these treatments do not offer as high cure rates as complete surgical excision.\n\nBecause the risk of invasive melanoma is small, one option in very elderly patients with large lentigo maligna is to simply photograph and watch the lesion carefully, biopsying any areas suspicious of invasive disease because of clinical or dermoscopic change."

If the lesion was invasive, regional lymph nodes should also be examined. It may be prudent to biopsy any lesion arising within or close to the excision site.\n\nThe risk of spread (metastatic melanoma) from invasive melanoma depends on several factors, but the main one is the thickness of the melanoma at the time it was surgically removed.\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand Melanoma Guidelines report that metastases are rare for melanomas < 0.75mm and the risk for tumours 0.75\u20131 mm thick is about 5%. The risk steadily increases with thickness so that melanomas > 4 mm result in a 10-year survival of around 50%, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) statistics."

There were 362 deaths from melanoma in 2016.\n\nMelanoma can occur in adults of any age but is very rare in children. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2021:\n\n\u2022 7.9% of people diagnosed with melanoma were aged under 40 years\n\u2022 10.7% were aged 40-49\n\u2022 17.8% were aged 50-59\n\u2022 23.9% were aged 60-69\n\u2022 23.7% were aged 70-79\n\u2022 16% were aged 80 or older.\n\nThe mean age for melanoma diagnosis is 65.7 years among men and 62.4 years among women.

They occur from damage to a cell during a person's life. The most common cause of melanoma is overexposure to UV radiation, eg, sun exposure, sunbed use.\n\u2022 Germline 'inherited' mutations are passed down from the parent. Inherited (familial) melanoma is far less common (<10%). CDKN2A (also called p16INK4A or MTS1) is the gene primarily linked in up to 20\u201340% of familial melanomas. However, in recent years, a growing number of other genes have been implicated, including CDK4, MC1R, MITF, TERT, ACD, BAP1, POT1, and TERF2IP.\n\nCutaneous melanoma can arise from otherwise normal-appearing skin (in about 75% of melanomas) or from within a pre-existing mole or freckle, which starts to grow larger and change in appearance. Precursor lesions include:\n\n\u2022 Benign melanocytic naevus (normal mole)\n\u2022 Atypical or dysplastic naevus (unusual-looking mole)\n\u2022 Atypical lentiginous junctional naevus (flat naevus in heavily sun-damaged skin) or atypical solar lentigo\n\u2022 Large or giant-sized congenital melanocytic naevus (brown birthmark).\n\nMelanomas have two growth phases, radial and vertical. Most melanomas arise as superficial tumours confined to the epidermis (ie, they have a horizontal growth phase; in situ). These generally grow slowly, but at any time, further genetic changes may cause the tumour to progress to the vertical growth phase, in which the malignant cells breach the basement membrane, invading deeper tissues, resulting in invasive melanoma.\n\nOnce the melanoma cells have reached the dermis, they may spread to other tissues via the lymphatic system to the local lymph nodes or via the bloodstream to other organs such as the lungs or brain. This is known as metastatic disease or secondary spread. The chance of this happening mainly depends on how deep the cells have penetrated the skin."

This may be supported by dermoscopy, confocal microscopy, total body photography (mole mapping), and adhesive patch genomic analysis, among other methods.\n\n\u2022 Dermoscopy \u2014 Some melanomas are extremely difficult to recognise clinically. The dermatoscopic appearance is helpful in the diagnosis of melanoma. Melanoma-specific criteria often include an atypical pigment network; brown-black dots\/globules; multiple (5\u20136) colours asymmetrically distributed; blue-white veil; depigmentation; and irregular vascular pattern. Dermoscopy monitoring should only be considered for flat or slightly raised lesions, whereas any suspicious or nodular lesions should be excised.\n\u2022 Confocal Microscopy \u2014 Where available, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may be useful for clinical and dermoscopic examination of suspected melanoma lesions. RCM is a live imaging technology that allows for instant viewing of the epidermis and papillary dermis with nearly histologic resolution. Areas of higher melanin concentration appear as bright areas on a confocal image. This technology is especially useful for identifying amelanotic or hypomelanotic melanomas, mapping surgical margins pre-operatively, and monitoring lesions over time.\n\u2022 Photographic skin surveillance \u2014 Where available, total body photography (TBP), eg, MoleMap, should be considered for high-risk individuals, particularly those with high naevus counts and dysplastic naevi. TBP provides a baseline for monitoring new lesions and changes in pre-existing naevi. While not all changed lesions need to be excised, if there is clinical or dermoscopic evidence for melanoma at any point, excision is recommended.\n\u2022 Radiographic investigations \u2014 Imaging, such as CT or PET, may be appropriate for staging or surveillance of melanomas that are at significant risk for distant metastases.\n\u2022 Adhesive patch genomic analysis \u2014 skin surface tape stripping is a non-invasive test that can be used on pigmented lesions to obtain their genomic signature. It can be used to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma.\n\nHistopathology is required for the definitive diagnosis of melanoma.\n\nWhere possible, suspicious lesions should be surgically removed by diagnostic excision with a 2 mm clinical margin and upper subcutis for pathological examination. A partial (incisional) biopsy is best avoided but may be considered where complete excision is not feasible, eg, large lesions. Nail biopsy for suspected melanoma of the nail is discussed elsewhere.\n\nThe pathological diagnosis of melanoma can be very difficult. Immunohistochemical stains may help confirm melanoma and include S-100, SOX10, MART-1, HMB-45, MITF, tyrosinase and PRAME.

It is a strong predictor of outcome; the thicker the melanoma, the more likely it is to metastasise (spread).\n\u2022 Clark level of invasion\u2014indicates the anatomic plane of invasion. Deeper Clark levels have a greater risk of metastasis. It is useful in predicting the outcome of thin tumours.

It may be given on its own (when the patient has a melanoma too widespread for surgery or is unfit for surgery), after surgery (particularly when there is a high risk of recurrence) or as a combination therapy.\n\nRadiation therapy should be considered in patients with a single or small number of brain metastases, painful bone metastases, problematic skin, soft tissue or nodal metastases that have not responded to systemic therapy. This may help relieve symptoms from the metastases."

        "response":"In Australia and New Zealand, it is recommended that lymphatic mapping with a sentinel node biopsy is performed for melanomas thicker than 1 mm or where the melanoma is greater than 0.75 mm with other high-risk pathological features. However, while the biopsy may help in staging cancer and directing the use of adjuvant therapies, it does not offer any survival advantage.\n\nWhen the sentinel node is removed it is assessed for the presence of malignant cells, which may indicate melanoma spread to other body parts. In the past, a positive sentinel node biopsy required a lymph node dissection to remove all the lymph nodes in the area. However, this is no longer the preferred treatment. Patients may choose to have the procedure to reduce the risk of lymph node field relapse."

It is usually seen in older people or in patients affected by diabetes mellitus or other conditions.\n\nType II necrotising fasciitis has been sensationalised in the media and is commonly referred to as a flesh-eating disease. It affects all age groups. Healthy people are also prone to infection with this group.\n\nType III necrotising fasciitis is caused by Clostridium perfringens or less commonly Clostridium septicum. It usually follows significant injury or surgery and results in gas under the skin: this makes a crackling sound called crepitus. People who inject \u201cblack tar\u201d heroin subcutaneously can also be infected with clostridia and develop necrotising fasciitis.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis due to marine organisms is usually due to contamination of wounds by seawater, cuts by fish fins or stingers, or consumption of raw seafood. It occurs more commonly in patients with liver disorders. These infections can be very serious and can be fatal if not attended within 48 hours.\n\nFungal necrotising fasciitis complicates traumatic wounds in immunocompromised people.\n\nOther terms used for necrotising fasciitis include haemolytic streptococcal gangrene, Meleney ulcer, acute dermal gangrene, hospital gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and synergistic necrotising cellulitis.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis affecting perineal, genital, and perianal regions is known as Fournier gangrene.

All five complete- response patients in the nicotinamide and tetracycline group remained disease-free during medication tapering over a 10-month follow-up period, while three patients in the prednisone group had repeated disease flare-ups with steroid tapering during the same period.\n\nPlacebo-controlled trials have suggested high-risk sun-damaged patients taking oral nicotinamide who have extensive actinic keratoses and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas may expect a reduction in the number of new lesions over time.

        "prompt":"Topical nicotinamide",
        "response":"Nicotinamide, available in a topical cream, gel and oral forms (eg, Nicomide\u00ae), has been shown to be effective in clearing acne. In a controlled clinical trial, 4% nicotinamide gel was found to be as effective as the topical antibiotic 1% clindamycin gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris in 76 patients with moderate acne. The study concluded that the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotinamide might have contributed to its success in acne.\n\nNicotinamide also reduces facial sebum production. Sebum is responsible for facial shine and contributes to noninflamed comedones and inflammatory acne lesions. Results of a well-controlled clinical trial in Caucasian and Japanese women have shown that application of 2% nicotinamide moisturiser to the face for 4-6 weeks reduces sebum production with significant differences in facial shine and oiliness.\n\nNicotinamide gel is marketed as an over-the-counter treatment for acne in Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, USA and Ireland. If a twice-daily application causes excessive drying of the skin, one may reduce to once a day, or every other day.\n\nThe clinical signs and symptoms of rosacea include increased facial skin dryness, redness and sensitivity. In at least two studies, moisturisers containing nicotinamide have been shown to improve skin barrier function in rosacea patients, leading to diminished reaction to irritants including cleansers and cosmetics.\n\nNicotinamide serves as a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are co-enzymes (facilitators of enzymatic reactions) essential for numerous metabolic pathways. These co-enzymes play a role in the metabolism of glucose, cellular energy production, and synthesis of lipids. The levels of NADH \/ NADPH (the reduced forms of NAD and NADP) decrease with age and topical nicotinamide appears to reverse the decline.\n\nIn multiple clinical studies, topical nicotinamide improved fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmented spots, red blotchiness, and skin sallowness (yellowing) as well as elasticity. One study showed nicotinamide to increase the skin's production of ceramides, which are natural emollients and skin protectants, thus improving skin hydration.\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-face, left-right, randomised 12-week study in 50 women evaluated the effects of 5% topical nicotinamide on various signs of skin ageing. The researchers reported topical nicotinamide resulted in significant improvement in fine lines\/wrinkles, pigmentation, texture and red blotchiness. The study was sponsored by Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAnother study of 30 healthy Japanese females reported improvement of eyelid wrinkles after eight weeks of application of a cosmetic containing 4% nicotinamide.\n\nNicotinamide is well tolerated and often can be used by those who cannot tolerate topical retinoids or fruit acids.\n\nUltraviolet radiation (UVR) is the main risk factor for skin cancer development. The mechanisms by which UVR leads to cancer are complex including direct damage to DNA and effects on the immune system. Nicotinamide has been shown to enhance the repair of direct and oxidative DNA damage in human keratinocytes and human skin. It has the potential to prevent UV-induced immune suppression, shown in a study of volunteers with a positive Mantoux test (positive tuberculin sensitivity test). The Mantoux reaction can be suppressed by exposure to UVR. Nicotinamide reduced this immune suppression when it was applied either before or after exposure to UVR (simulating sunlight exposure).\n\nIn a randomised controlled clinical trial in 50 patients, 1% nicotinamide gel applied twice daily to the head, forearms and hands for six months reduced the mean number of precancerous actinic keratoses by 28%.\n\nNicotinamide does not work as a sunscreen (and does not prevent sunburn). It does not have antioxidant properties, but it may affect the complement cascade, cell energy metabolism, and apoptosis (cell death).\n\nApproved datasheets are the official source of information for medicines, including approved uses, doses, and safety information.

The disease is called contagious pustular dermatitis or scabby mouth in the animal because it forms crusts and scabs around nose, mouth, teats and elsewhere. As it reduces suckling, the animal can lose weight. The disease lasts about six weeks. It is highly contagious, so several animals in the herd may be infected.\n\nWho gets orf?\n\nHuman lesions are caused by direct inoculation of infected material, often through an existing scratch or cut.\n\nOrf is a risk for sheep farmers, shearers, freezing workers, or anyone that bottle-feeds a lamb. Children may also acquire it from playing on infected pasture or in a sheep shed. Butchers, meat porters and housewives are sometimes infected from carcasses, especially sheep heads.\n\nHuman orf has been reported after accidental contact with orf virus vaccine intended for the animals.\n\nIt is not usually transmitted from human to human, although this has been rarely reported.\n\nWhat are the clinical features of orf?\n\nOrf lesions are generally solitary or few in number. They occur most commonly on the fingers, hands or forearms but can appear on the face.\n\nAfter an incubation period of 5\u20136 days, a small, firm, red or reddish-blue lump enlarges to form a flat-topped, blood-tinged pustule or blister. The fully developed lesion is usually 2\u20133 cm in diameter but may be as large as 5 cm. Characteristically, although there appears to be pus under the white skin, incising this will reveal firm, red tissue underneath. The orf lesion is sometimes irritable during the early stages and is often tender.\n\nRed streaks up the lymph channels (lymphangitis) with enlargement of the lymph glands on the inner side of the elbow and\/or under the arm (lymphadenopathy) are not uncommon.

Vaccination of the herd using a live virus is recommended if there is a significant outbreak of orf. The vaccine causes a mild orf scab to develop at the vaccination site and should not be used in healthy herds where there is no history of orf. Vaccinated animals should be kept separate from unvaccinated animals until the scab has healed. Sheds should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected."

One theory implicates a tryptophan-dependent metabolic pathway.\n\nThe yeasts induce enlarged melanosomes (pigment granules) within basal melanocytes in the brown type of pityriasis versicolor. It is easier to demonstrate the yeasts in scrapings taken from this type of pityriasis versicolor than in those taken from the white type.\n\nThe white or hypopigmented type of pityriasis versicolor is thought to be due to a chemical produced by malassezia that diffuses into the epidermis and impairs the function of the melanocytes.\n\nThe pink type of pityriasis versicolor is mildly inflamed, due to dermatiits induced by malassezia or its metabolites."

This major histocompatibility complex is not associated with psoriatic arthritis, nail psoriasis, or late-onset psoriasis.\n\nImmune factors and inflammatory cytokines (messenger proteins) such as IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, IL-23, and IL-17 are responsible for the clinical features of psoriasis.

The scale is typically silvery white, except in skin folds where the plaques often appear shiny with a moist peeling surface. The most common sites are the scalp, elbows, and knees, but any part of the skin can be involved. The plaques are usually very persistent without treatment.\n\nItch is mostly mild but may be severe in some patients, leading to scratching and lichenification characterised by thickened leathery skin and increased skin markings. Painful skin cracks or fissures may occur, particularly on the palms and soles.\n\nPsoriasis can demonstrate the Koebner phenomenon. This involves the generation of new lesions on the skin that has been damaged or irritated such as by injury, burns etc.\n\nWhen psoriatic plaques clear up, they may leave brown or pale marks (postinflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation) that can be expected to fade over several months.\n\nAuspitz sign refers to pinpoint bleeding upon removal of the scaly layer in plaque psoriasis.

It involves applying appropriately diluted allergens to the skin, usually on the back for convenience, for 48 hours. The patch tests are then read at 96 hours as reactions usually take 48\u201396 hours to develop. Positive reactions produce a patch of dermatitis at the application site of the offending allergen, which will appear as a red and possibly raised, vesicular and even blistering area.\n\nDermatitis can be thought of as being exogenous (eg, irritants, allergens, and sometimes light) or endogenous. In practice, dermatitis may be of mixed cause. Patch testing is largely of value in determining the cause of allergic contact dermatitis, and is not useful in investigating irritant dermatitis. Patch testing has some limited value in investigating some types of drug allergy, and a specialised type of patch testing is used for investigating photo contact allergy (photopatch testing).\n\nRepeat open application testing can sometimes help identify a suspect item (usually a personal care product) if there is a delay in formal patch testing \u2014 the product is applied twice a day to a 5 cm diameter area of forearm skin for 5\u00ad\u201310 days. No visible redness or swelling means contact allergy to that product is unlikely.

After carefully marking the position of the patch test panels, they are removed at 48 hours, and the skin inspected 48 hours after that.\n\nDuring patch testing, it is best to:\n\n\u2022 Be taking less than 10 mg of oral prednisolone a day\n\u2022 Not be on an immunosuppressive agent that will reduce the reaction\n\u2022 Avoid potent topical steroids to the application site for three days before patch testing is commenced\n\u2022 Avoid bathing or showering the test area which will wash off the panels or the identification marking\n\u2022 Avoid excessive exercise that may dislodge the allergen tapes.\n\nAntihistamines can be taken as normal as they do not interfere with the type IV hypersensitivity reaction."

The rash can be difficult to detect in dark-skinned people. When present, it is found on the trunk and upper arms and legs, but almost never on the face, palms or soles. The rash appears as pink or red macules (flat spots) or papules (small lumps), which spread outwards in a circular shape. As the lesions advance, the edges become raised and red, and the centre clears. The lesions are not itchy or painful, and sometimes go unnoticed by the patient. The lesions can fade and reappear within hours, reappearing in hot conditions. Erythema marginatum may persist intermittently for weeks to months, even after successful treatment of ARF.\n\u2022 Subcutaneous nodules (small lumps under the skin) \u2013 These are uncommon, occurring in less than 2% of patients with ARF. The painless nodules are found over joints (such as the elbows, knees, ankles, and knuckles), the back of the scalp, and the vertebrae (backbone).

Drugs causing vasoconstriction should be discontinued, if possible.\n\nFirst line medications for primary Raynaud phenomenon include calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine or diltiazem. Verapamil appears ineffective. The calcium channel blockers act by dilating the small blood vessels, thereby increasing the blood flow to the peripheries.

The epidermis also contains pigment cells called melanocytes, which produce melanin, Langerhans cells, which present antigens to the immune system, and Merkel cells, which have a sensory function.\n\n\u2022 Basal layer \u2014 the columnar or rectangular cells at the bottom of the epidermis from which new cells are continuously produced. Scattered melanocytes are normally found in this layer.\n\u2022 Squamous cells \u2014 flat epithelial cells found on the skin surface. The structure of the skin is described as a stratified squamous epithelium, referring to the way the cells are built up in layers.\n\u2022 Granular layer \u2014 flattened cells filled with dark granules containing keratohyaline protein.\n\u2022 Horny layer \u2014 stacks of dead cells without nuclei make up the dry or keratinised stratum corneum.

New hair continues to grow. Telogen hair is also known as a club hair due to the shape of the root.\n\nIt should be distinguished from anagen effluvium, in which the hair shedding is due to interruption of active or anagen hair growth by drugs, toxins or inflammation (eg, alopecia areata). Anagen hair has a pointed or tapered tip."

    {
        "prompt":"What is the cause of telogen effluvium?",
        "response":"In a normal healthy person's scalp, about 85% of the hair follicles are actively growing hair (anagen hair) and about 15% are resting hair (telogen hair). A few hairs may also be in catagen. A hair follicle usually grows anagen hair for 4 years or so, then rests for about 4 months. A new anagen hair begins to grow under the resting telogen hair and pushes it out.\n\nThus, it is normal to lose up to about 100 hairs a day on one's comb, brush, in the basin or on the pillow, as a result of the normal scalp hair cycle.\n\nIf there is some shock to the system, as many as 70% of the anagen hairs can be precipitated into telogen, thus reversing the usual ratio. Typical triggers include:\n\n\u2022 Childbirth: postpartum hair loss. This can resolve after a few months or transition into female pattern alopecia.\n\u2022 Physiological neonatal hair loss\n\u2022 Acute or chronic illness, especially if there is fever\n\u2022 Surgical operation\n\u2022 Accident\n\u2022 Psychological stress\n\u2022 Weight loss, unusual diet, or nutritional deficiency (eg, iron deficiency\/)\n\u2022 Certain medications\n\u2022 Endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism)\n\u2022 Discontinuing the contraceptive pill\n\u2022 Overseas travel resulting in jetlag\n\u2022 Skin disease affecting the scalp (eg, erythroderma)\n\u2022 Excessive sun exposure."

        "prompt":"What are the clinical features of acute telogen effluvium?",
        "response":"Telogen effluvium is a non-scarring form of diffuse hair loss with no clinical or histological evidence of inflammation and can affect up to 50% of the scalp hair.\n\nThe resting scalp club hairs remain firmly attached to the hair follicles at first. The new hairs coming up through the scalp push out the resting club hairs and increased hair fall is noticed 2 to 4 months after the triggering event.\n\nThus, paradoxically, with this type of hair loss, hair fall is a sign of hair regrowth.\n\n\u2022 As the new hair first comes up through the scalp and pushes out the dead hair, a fine fringe of new hair is often evident along the forehead hairline.\n\u2022 At first, the fall of club hairs is profuse and a general thinning of the scalp hair may become evident but after several months a peak is reached and hair fall begins to lessen, gradually tapering back to normal over 6\u20139 months in most cases.\n\u2022 As the hair fall tapers off, the scalp thickens back up to normal, but recovery may be incomplete in some cases.\n\nBecause nail and hair growth are under the same influences, an arrest in hair growth is often mirrored in the nails by a groove across them coinciding with the time of the shock to the system \u2014 a Beau line. The time of the shock can be estimated from the fact that a fingernail takes 5 months to grow from the posterior nail fold to the free edge. So if the groove in the nail is halfway down the nail, the shock must have been two and a half months ago.\n\nIn some patients, hair shedding continues to be intermittently or continuously greater than normal for long periods of time, sometimes for years. The hair cycle appears to be reset so that the anagen period is shortened.\n\nChronic telogen effluvium often presents in women that actually continue to have quite thick and moderately long hair \u2013 this is because they notice the shed hair more than those with finer or shorter hair. Telogen effluvium does not cause complete baldness, although it may unmask a genetic tendency to genetic balding i.e. female pattern hair loss, or in men, male pattern hair loss.\n\nThe mechanism of chronic telogen effluvium is not well understood. Middle-aged women with a long fluctuating course of telogen effluvium, producing widespread thinning lasting many years have normal hormonal studies."

Phototherapy may relieve the itch of symptomatic dermographism.\n\nIf non-sedating antihistamines are not effective, a 4 to 5-day course of oral prednisone (prednisolone) may be warranted in severe acute urticaria.\n\nIntramuscular injection of adrenaline (epinephrine) is reserved for life-threatening anaphylaxis or swelling of the throat.\n\nPatients with chronic urticaria that has failed to respond to maximum-dose second-generation oral antihistamines taken for four weeks should be referred to a dermatologist, immunologist or medical allergy specialist.\n\nThere is good evidence to support treatment with omalizumab or ciclosporin, which each have a 65% response rate in antihistamine-resistant patients.\n\nLong-term systemic corticosteroids are not recommended, as high doses are required to reduce symptoms of urticaria and they have inevitable adverse effects that can be serious.\n\nThe effectiveness of treatment can be objectively monitored using urticaria control test. Patients are asked to score the physical symptoms of urticaria they have experienced in the previous four weeks, quality of life affected by urticaria, how often treatment was not enough to control symptoms, and overall control of urticaria."

        "prompt":"What causes urticaria in children?",
        "response":"Weals are caused by a number of chemical mediators, such as histamine and cytokines, which are released from inflammatory cells, including mast cells. The mediators cause vasodilation and leakage of fluid into surrounding tissues to produce the redness and swelling of urticarial weals.\n\nTriggers of acute spontaneous urticaria can include:\n\n\u2022 Viral infection (in 40% of cases), such as upper respiratory tract infection, viral hepatitis, or glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis)\n\u2022 Bacterial infection, such as sinusitis or a dental abscess\n\u2022 Food allergy, usually on or after the first exposure to a particular food such as egg, milk, soy, peanut, and wheat\n\u2022 Drug-induced urticaria, such as that caused by an antibiotic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)\n\u2022 Bee or wasp sting.\n\nThere is no obvious trigger in approximately 50% of cases of acute urticaria. This may be called \u2018idiopathic\u2019 urticaria.\n\nChronic urticaria is usually caused by autoimmunity or a chronic underlying infection. It is rare in children.\n\nInducible urticaria is caused by a direct stimulus, such as dermographism, delayed pressure, cold, heat, sunlight, vibration, or exercise. It is linked with atopy and chronic urticaria, but the pathogenesis is not fully understood."

They are either white or red and can be either localised or widespread. Weals change shape and size and each one lasts from a few minutes to several hours.\n\nAngioedema is usually localised to a single area such as the hands, feet, and genitalia. It most commonly affects the face in children. The child may have a swollen tongue, eyelids, or lips. Angioedema is often tender or painful.\n\nInducible urticaria due to a physical stimulus often comes on within minutes after exposure and resolves in less than an hour.

The lesions persist for several days or longer.\n\u2022 Contact dermatitis \u2014 this presents on areas in contact with a causative irritant or allergen with irregular, red, blistered, scaly, sometimes swollen, plaques. Dermatitis persists for days to weeks, much longer than urticarial weals.\n\u2022 Erythema multiforme \u2014 erythematous plaques are usually located on acral sites (the hands, arms, feet, legs, or face). Target lesions (a pattern of concentric rings) are characteristic, sometimes with central blistering. Each plaque persists days to weeks.\n\u2022 Urticarial vasculitis \u2014 this is uncommon.

The patient may be aware of the multiple small lumps, but typically they are asymptomatic and an incidental finding.\n\nEpidermoid cysts are commonly found on the cutaneous aspect of the labia majora of middle-aged and elderly women. The cysts may be solitary or multiple, spontaneous or post-surgical, usually presenting as a painless lump up to a centimetre in diameter. Giant epidermoid cyst of the vulva has been described.\n\nCysts of the Bartholin gland or Skene duct contain clear mucoid fluid. Bartholin glands are located towards the back and side of the introitus at the 4 o\u2019clock and 8 o\u2019clock positions. Skene glands are adjacent to the distal urethra. Cysts may present as a lump, or as painful swelling if the cyst has become infected and an abscess has formed. Bartholin duct cysts are reported to affect 2% of adult women at some time in their life. Skene duct cysts can also present in neonates. Diagnosis is usually made by the anatomic location of the cyst.\n\nMucinous cysts develop from minor vestibular glands found on the inner labia minora along Hart lines. Cysts may be found incidentally, present as a palpable lump noticed by the patient, or cause pain should the cyst become inflamed. Vestibular mucinous cysts typically develop between puberty and the fourth decade.\n\nA cyst of the canal of Nuck is a developmental anomaly due to incomplete closure of the round ligament and is the equivalent of a spermatic cord hydrocele in males. It presents as a skin-coloured, asymptomatic swelling located in the inguinal area and labium majorum, resembling an inguinal hernia. It is usually detected by five years of age.\n\nA Gartner, or mesonephric, cyst develops in remnants of an incompletely regressed mesonephric duct. The mesonephric duct forms the male sexual organs, so should regress completely in the female fetus. Persistent mesonephric duct remnants in a female are usually associated with congenital abnormalities of the metanephric urinary system such as an ectopic ureter, unilateral renal agenesis or hypoplasia. A Gartner cyst is a small solitary unilateral cyst on the front vaginal wall towards one side, which may bulge to present as an interlabial mass in late adolescence.\n\nAt the ninth week of gestation, the paramesonephric duct develops into the fallopian tube. Remnants of this duct can form a ciliated, or paramesonephric, cyst found incidentally on the labium majorum during pregnancy, puberty, or with other hormonal influences. The lesion is usually a single cyst cavity, 1\u20133 cm in diameter, and drains clear or amber-coloured fluid if ruptured.\n\nEruptive vellus hair cysts present as multiple small yellow-brown papules usually on the front of the trunk but have been rarely reported on the labia majora.\n\nSteatocystoma is an autosomal dominant skin condition resulting in an abnormal proliferation of the pilosebaceous duct junction. The resultant skin papules drain an oily fluid when punctured. Involvement localised to the vulva has been rarely reported as a late-onset sporadic condition.\n\nPilonidal disease is usually found at the upper end of the gluteal cleft, but has been reported as a painless papule or nodule on the vulva, particularly in the area around the clitoris, due to an ingrown hair forming a dermoid cyst.\n\nCutaneous endometriosis can rarely occur on the vulva at the site of previous obstetric or surgical trauma. It presents as nodules, patches, or cysts filled with fresh or clotted blood."

        "prompt":"What causes vitiligo?",
        "response":"Vitiligo is due to the loss or destruction of melanocytes (melanin-producing cells).\n\nGenetic factors appear to contribute to 80% of vitiligo risk, whilst environmental factors account for 20%. Many genetic loci have been identified, all related to the immune system, except for TYR which encodes tyrosinase, a key enzyme in melanin production and a major autoantigen in vitiligo.\n\nThe convergence or integrated theory combines immunological, biochemical, oxidative, and environmental mechanisms that work jointly in those with a genetic susceptibility is widely accepted.\n\nThis could be explained through three phases:\n\n\u2022 Initial phase: less adhesive melanocytes are prone to internal and external oxidative stresses, leading to the production of more toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n\u2022 Progression phase: an imbalance between ROS and antioxidants will activate the adaptive immune system bridged by the innate immune system.\n\nCD8+ cytotoxic cells release cytokines, mainly interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3) that activate the JAK-STAT pathway through its receptors on keratinocytes. This will lead to the production of chemokines (CXC), predominantly by keratinocytes, but also by melanocytes themselves, leading to IFN-\u03b3\u2013CXCR3- CXCL9\/10 axis loop feedback.\nActing together on their common CXCR3 receptor, CXCL9 drives the main bulk of CD8+ cell homing, while CXCL10 promotes their localisation to affected skin lesions and induction of melanocyte apoptosis through CXC3B activation.

These TRM cells may be responsible for what is called an \u2018autoimmune memory\u2019, in which relapses occur mostly at the same exact site of previous lesions.\n\nUnderstanding the molecular pathogenesis of vitiligo serves as a promising source for the development of more targeted therapies.\n\nVitiligo is also a component of some rare multiorgan syndromes, such as:\n\n\u2022 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome\n\u2022 Alezzandrini syndrome.\n\nThese syndromes affect organs that normally house melanocytes, and are now believed to constitute one disease entity with variable clinical expression.\n\nOther rare dermatologic syndromes that present with lesions indistinguishable from vitiligo are:\n\n\u2022 APECED (APS1) syndrome\n\u2022 Schmidt\u2019s (APS2) syndrome.\n\nA vitiligo-like leukoderma may occur in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\nVitiligo can also be induced by drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) used to treat metastatic melanoma."

Compared to long-standing patches, new ones are more likely to respond to medical therapy.\n\nWhile the hair follicle is the main source of pigment restoration, another potential reservoir can be at the borders of the white patches. When successful re-pigmentation occurs, melanocyte stem cells (DOPA-negative) in the middle and lower outer root sheath (ORS), or bulge at the base of the hair follicle are activated (become larger, with intense DOPA oxidase activity).

The psychosocial impacts of vitiligo tend to be more severe in some countries, cultures, and religions than in others.\n\nFamily support, counselling, and cognitive behavioural treatment can be of benefit."

At the same time, Vitamin K dependent proteins C and S are inactivated \u2013 these are natural anticoagulants.\n\nHalf the activated Protein C disappears within 6 hours (its half-life). So, Protein C runs out during the first few days of warfarin therapy, before Factor X and II disappear, which have half-lives of 2-5 days. In some circumstances, this leads to excessive clotting.\n\nWhy the skin necrosis happens in the areas of fat abundance is unclear; possibly these areas are more susceptible because of reduced blood supply.\n\nWarfarin-induced calciphylaxis may be due to inhibition of the matrix protein Gla, which normally prevents calcium deposition in the blood vessels."

For each type of flap, a basic diagram explaining the design is included.\n\nAn incision from the wound edge towards the side of the wound is made. The area of adjacent skin is undermined and advanced laterally to approximate wound edges. Excess skin at the end of the incision needs to be addressed by excising it (\"dog-ear correction\"), as shown in the drawing, or with a Z-plasty.\n\nA semicircular incision is made starting at the wound edge. The area of adjacent skin is undermined and advanced towards the wound edges by rotating it. Similar to the advancement flap, it is usually required to adjust for excess skin at the end of the incision. Rotation and advancement flaps are similar in design and often overlap.\n\nAlso referred to as a V-Y flap. A V-shaped incision is made, after which the area underneath this is undermined leaving a subcutaneous pedicle intact for blood supply. This results in a piece of pedicled skin (the island) that can be freely moved toward the wound edge, creating a Y-shaped scar.\n\nThis type of flap involves lifting tissue into the defect over the top of the intact surrounding skin. One of the basic types of transposition flaps is a rhomboid flap, the design of which is shown in the schematic drawing. When the donor site is too far away from the recipient site (the wound), a vascular pedicle can be left intact that is also transposed over or under an area of normal skin forming a bridge or tunnel. This is called an interpolation flap. The pedicle is divided at a later stage when new blood supply at the donor site has been formed. Common examples of this type of flap are the paramedian forehead, melolebial and retroauricular flaps.\n\nTissue from a distant site is cut loose from the donor site and reattached to the vasculature of the recipient site."
